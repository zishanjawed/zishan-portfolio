## Goal
Create a secure API route for handling contact form submissions with server-side validation, Turnstile verification, and email/webhook integration.

## Background
The contact API route needs to handle form submissions securely with proper validation, spam protection, and reliable email delivery. It should include rate limiting, error handling, and logging for monitoring and debugging.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `/app/api/contact/route.ts` API route
2. Implement server-side form validation with Zod schemas
3. Add Cloudflare Turnstile server-side verification
4. Implement rate limiting (10 requests per minute per IP)
5. Add email notification via webhook integration
6. Store contact submissions in JSON log
7. Implement proper error handling and responses
8. Add security headers and CSRF protection
9. Implement logging for monitoring and debugging
10. Add analytics tracking for form submissions

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the contact API route file
2. Implement server-side validation using Zod schemas
3. Add Turnstile server-side verification
4. Implement rate limiting middleware
5. Set up email webhook integration
6. Create JSON logging system
7. Add comprehensive error handling
8. Implement security headers
9. Add logging and monitoring
10. Integrate analytics tracking
