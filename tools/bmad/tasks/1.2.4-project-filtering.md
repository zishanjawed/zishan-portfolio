2. Implement filtering logic for technology, category, and client
3. Add URL state management for filter parameters
4. Implement smooth transitions for filtered results
5. Add "clear filters" functionality
6. Ensure filtering works with keyboard navigation
7. Add filter analytics tracking
8. Implement filter persistence across page reloads
9. Add loading states for filter changes
10. Ensure accessibility compliance for filter controls

## Implementation Steps
1. Create filtering UI components
2. Implement filtering logic and state management
3. Add URL state management for filters
4. Implement smooth transitions and animations
5. Add clear filters functionality
6. Implement keyboard navigation for filters
7. Add analytics tracking for filter usage
8. Implement filter persistence
9. Add loading states for filter operations
