## DependsOn
Task 1.6.2 (Typed Content Loaders)

## Goal
Implement fuzzy search algorithm for content matching across all portfolio content types with optimal performance and accuracy.

## Background
The portfolio needs a powerful fuzzy search feature that can search across projects, experience, skills, and writing content. The algorithm should provide flexible matching with good performance and relevant results.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement fuzzy search algorithm using Fuse.js or similar library
2. Configure search across all content types (projects, experience, skills, writing)
3. Add search result ranking and relevance scoring
4. Implement search result highlighting and preview
5. Add search performance optimization and caching
6. Implement search result categorization by content type
7. Add search analytics and tracking
8. Ensure search works with large content sets
9. Add search result keyboard navigation
10. Implement search error handling and fallbacks

## Implementation Steps
1. Install and configure Fuse.js or similar fuzzy search library
2. Implement search across all content types
3. Add search result ranking and relevance scoring
4. Implement search result highlighting
5. Add performance optimization and caching
6. Implement search result categorization
7. Add search analytics tracking
8. Optimize for large content sets
9. Add keyboard navigation
10. Implement error handling
