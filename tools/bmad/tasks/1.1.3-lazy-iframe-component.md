## DependsOn
Task 1.1.2 (Writing Card Component)

## Goal
Create a CLS-safe lazy iframe component that loads external content on demand while preventing layout shifts and respecting user preferences.

## Background
The lazy iframe component needs to load external content (like Medium articles, Dev.to posts) without causing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). It should use Intersection Observer for lazy loading and provide proper fallbacks for accessibility and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `/components/content/lazy-iframe.tsx` component
2. Implement Intersection Observer for lazy loading
3. Add CLS-safe aspect ratio containers
4. Implement skeleton loading states
5. Add error handling for failed iframe loads
6. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
7. Add proper accessibility attributes
8. Implement fallback for blocked iframes
9. Add analytics tracking for iframe interactions
10. Ensure performance optimization with proper cleanup

## Implementation Steps
1. Create the lazy iframe component file
2. Implement Intersection Observer for lazy loading
3. Add aspect ratio containers to prevent CLS
4. Create skeleton loading states
5. Implement error handling and fallbacks
6. Add reduced motion support
7. Implement accessibility features
8. Add analytics tracking
9. Optimize performance with proper cleanup
10. Test across different devices and scenarios

## File Locations
- `/components/content/lazy-iframe.tsx` - Lazy iframe component
- `/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Skeleton loading component
- `/lib/analytics.ts` - Analytics tracking utilities

## Testing
- Test lazy loading with Intersection Observer
- Verify CLS remains under 0.1 during iframe loads
- Test error handling with blocked iframes
- Verify reduced motion support
- Test accessibility with screen reader
- Validate performance impact
