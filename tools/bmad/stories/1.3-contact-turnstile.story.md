## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to contact Zishan securely without spam interference,
**so that** I can reach out for professional opportunities with confidence.

## Goal
Implement a secure contact form with Cloudflare Turnstile integration, server-side verification, and webhook handling to provide spam protection while ensuring reliable communication.

## Background
The contact form needs robust spam protection using Cloudflare Turnstile, server-side verification of tokens, and webhook integration for reliable form processing. The implementation must handle edge cases, provide proper error handling, and ensure data security while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Create contact form with name, email, subject, and message fields
2. ✅ Integrate Cloudflare Turnstile widget with proper configuration
3. ✅ Implement server-side Turnstile token verification
4. ✅ Add Zod schema validation for all form inputs
5. ✅ Implement rate limiting (10 requests per minute per IP)
6. ✅ Send email notifications via webhook integration
7. ✅ Store contact submissions in JSON log for backup
8. ✅ Provide clear success and error messages to users
9. ✅ Implement proper error handling for all failure scenarios
10. ✅ Add analytics tracking for form submissions and failures

## Test Steps
1. ✅ Fill out contact form and verify Turnstile widget appears
2. ✅ Submit form with valid data and verify success message
3. ✅ Test server-side Turnstile verification with valid/invalid tokens
4. ✅ Verify Zod validation rejects invalid form data
5. ✅ Test rate limiting by submitting multiple forms quickly
6. ✅ Verify email notifications are sent via webhook
7. ✅ Check JSON log for contact submission storage
8. ✅ Test error handling with network failures
9. ✅ Verify analytics tracking for form interactions
10. ✅ Test accessibility with screen reader and keyboard navigation
