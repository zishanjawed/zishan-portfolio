Story 1.6 (Zod Schemas + Typed Loaders)

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to quickly search through Zishan's content and projects,
**so that** I can efficiently find specific information and navigate the portfolio.

## Goal
Implement client-side fuzzy search functionality with keyboard shortcut activation ("/" key) to provide fast, responsive search across all portfolio content including projects, experience, skills, and writing.

## Background
The portfolio needs a powerful search feature that allows visitors to quickly find specific content. Fuzzy search will provide flexible matching, while the "/" keyboard shortcut will make search easily accessible. The implementation must be fast, responsive, and provide relevant search results across all content types.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement fuzzy search across all content types (projects, experience, skills, writing)
2. Add "/" keyboard shortcut to focus search input
3. Create search modal/overlay with keyboard navigation
4. Implement real-time search results with debouncing
5. Add search result highlighting and preview
6. Ensure search works with keyboard navigation only
7. Implement search result categorization by content type
8. Add search analytics and tracking
9. Ensure search performance with large content sets
10. Add search result keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, enter, escape)

## Test Steps
1. Press "/" key and verify search modal opens
2. Type search terms and verify real-time results appear
3. Test fuzzy search with partial matches and typos
4. Verify search results are categorized by content type
5. Test keyboard navigation through search results
6. Check search performance with large content sets
7. Verify search analytics tracking works correctly
8. Test search modal accessibility with screen reader
9. Verify search result highlighting and preview functionality
10. Test search keyboard shortcuts and modal behavior

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search algorithm for content matching (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add "/" keyboard shortcut listener for search focus (AC: 2)
- [ ] Create search modal/overlay component (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement real-time search with debouncing (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add search result highlighting and preview (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for search results (AC: 6)
- [ ] Add search result categorization by content type (AC: 7)
- [ ] Implement search analytics tracking (AC: 8)
- [ ] Optimize search performance for large content sets (AC: 9)
- [ ] Add search keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, enter, escape) (AC: 10)
- [ ] Create search utility functions and hooks (AC: 1, 4)
- [ ] Add search accessibility features (AC: 6, 8)
- [ ] Implement search result caching for performance (AC: 9)

## Dev Notes
- **Fuzzy Search**: Use Fuse.js or similar library for fuzzy matching across content
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement global keyboard listener for "/" key
- **Search Modal**: Create accessible modal with proper focus management
- **Performance**: Implement search result caching and debouncing for optimal performance
- **Content Types**: Search across projects, experience, skills, and writing content
- **File Locations**:
  - `/components/search/search-modal.tsx` - Search modal component
  - `/components/search/search-results.tsx` - Search results component
  - `/lib/search/fuzzy-search.ts` - Fuzzy search implementation
  - `/lib/search/search-utils.ts` - Search utility functions
  - `/hooks/use-search.ts` - Search custom hook
  - `/app/layout.tsx` - Global keyboard listener

## Testing
- **Search Tests**: Test fuzzy search accuracy and performance
- **Keyboard Tests**: Test keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- **Performance Tests**: Test search performance with large datasets
- **Accessibility Tests**: Test search accessibility and screen reader support
- **Integration Tests**: Test search integration with all content types
