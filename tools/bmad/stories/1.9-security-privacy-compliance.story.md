## Technical Requirements

### Security Headers Configuration

1. **Content Security Policy**
   ```typescript
   const cspDirectives = {
     'default-src': ["'self'"],
     'script-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://challenges.cloudflare.com'],
     'style-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
     'img-src': ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
     'connect-src': ["'self'", 'https://api.cloudflare.com'],
     'frame-src': ["'none'"],
     'object-src': ["'none'"],
     'base-uri': ["'self'"],
     'form-action': ["'self'"],
   };
   ```

2. **Security Headers Implementation**
   ```typescript
   const securityHeaders = {
     'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
     'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
     'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
     'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
     'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()',
   };
   ```

### Privacy Compliance Components

1. **Cookie Consent Manager**
   ```typescript
   interface CookieConsent {
     analytics: boolean;
     necessary: boolean;
     preferences: boolean;
     timestamp: string;
     version: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Privacy Policy Generator**
   ```typescript
   interface PrivacyPolicy {
     dataCollection: DataCollectionInfo;
     dataUsage: DataUsageInfo;
     userRights: UserRightsInfo;
     contactInfo: ContactInfo;
     lastUpdated: string;
   }
   ```

### Security Monitoring

1. **Audit Log Model**
   ```typescript
   interface SecurityAuditLog {
     timestamp: string;
     event: string;
     userAgent: string;
     ipAddress: string;
     action: string;
     result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'blocked';
     details: Record<string, any>;
   }
   ```

2. **Security Alert Model**
   ```typescript
   interface SecurityAlert {
     id: string;
     type: 'failed_login' | 'suspicious_activity' | 'attack_detected';
     severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
     description: string;
     timestamp: string;
