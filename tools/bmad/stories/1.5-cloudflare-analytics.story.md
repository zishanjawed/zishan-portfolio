6. ✅ Configure analytics dashboard and reporting
7. ✅ Ensure analytics don't impact site performance
8. ✅ Add opt-out mechanism for privacy-conscious users
9. ✅ Implement analytics error handling and fallbacks
10. ✅ Set up automated performance alerts and reporting

## Test Steps
1. ✅ Verify Cloudflare Analytics script loads correctly
2. ✅ Test page view tracking across all pages
3. ✅ Verify custom event tracking for user interactions
4. ✅ Check analytics dashboard shows data correctly
5. ✅ Test performance impact of analytics script
6. ✅ Verify privacy compliance and cookie-free tracking
7. ✅ Test opt-out mechanism functionality
8. ✅ Check error handling when analytics fails to load
