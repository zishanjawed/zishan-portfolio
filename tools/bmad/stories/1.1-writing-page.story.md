## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to explore Zishan's writing and external content,
**so that** I can understand his thought leadership and expertise in fintech and engineering.

## Goal
Create a dedicated writing page that showcases Zishan's external content, blog posts, and thought leadership pieces with CLS-safe iframe embeds and proper external link handling.

## Background
The portfolio needs a writing section to showcase Zishan's expertise through external content, blog posts, and thought leadership pieces. This should include both direct external links and optional lazy-loaded iframe embeds for platforms like Medium, Dev.to, or personal blog posts. The implementation must be CLS-safe and respect user preferences for reduced motion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `/writing` page with responsive grid layout for content cards
2. Display external writing links with proper metadata (title, description, platform, date)
3. Implement lazy iframe embeds for supported platforms (Medium, Dev.to, personal blog)
4. Ensure CLS-safe loading with proper aspect ratios and skeleton screens
5. Add external link indicators and proper accessibility attributes
6. Implement content filtering by platform/category
7. Add JSON-LD structured data for Article entities
8. Ensure all iframe embeds respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
9. Implement proper error handling for failed iframe loads
10. Add analytics tracking for external link clicks

## Test Steps
1. Navigate to `/writing` page and verify responsive layout
2. Test external link functionality and verify proper indicators
3. Test lazy iframe loading with network throttling
4. Verify CLS measurements remain under 0.1 during iframe loads
5. Test accessibility with screen reader and keyboard navigation
6. Verify reduced motion support for iframe animations
7. Test content filtering functionality
8. Validate JSON-LD structured data with Google Rich Results Test
9. Test error handling by disabling network for iframe loads
10. Verify analytics tracking for link interactions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create writing page component with responsive grid layout (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement content card component with metadata display (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add external link indicators and accessibility attributes (AC: 5)
- [ ] Create lazy iframe component with CLS-safe loading (AC: 4)
- [ ] Implement iframe fallback and error handling (AC: 9)
- [ ] Add content filtering by platform/category (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement reduced motion support for iframe animations (AC: 8)
- [ ] Add JSON-LD structured data for Article entities (AC: 7)
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking for external link clicks (AC: 10)
- [ ] Create writing content JSON schema and sample data (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add comprehensive accessibility testing (AC: 5, 6)
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring for iframe loads (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- **Content Structure**: Create `/data/writing.json` with array of writing items including title, description, url, platform, date, and embedType
- **Iframe Implementation**: Use Intersection Observer for lazy loading, implement proper aspect ratio containers to prevent CLS
- **Platform Support**: Focus on Medium, Dev.to, and personal blog embeds initially
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all external links have `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and proper aria labels
- **Performance**: Implement iframe loading with skeleton screens and error boundaries
- **SEO**: Add proper meta tags and structured data for writing content
- **File Locations**: 
  - `/app/writing/page.tsx` - Main writing page
  - `/components/content/writing-card.tsx` - Content card component
  - `/components/content/lazy-iframe.tsx` - Lazy iframe component
  - `/data/writing.json` - Writing content data
  - `/schemas/writing.ts` - Zod schema for writing content

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test writing card component, lazy iframe component, and content filtering
- **Integration Tests**: Test content loading from JSON and iframe embedding
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete writing page functionality and external link behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Verify CLS remains under 0.1 during iframe loads
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
