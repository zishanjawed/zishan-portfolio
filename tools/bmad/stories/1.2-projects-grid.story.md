## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to browse Zishan's projects in an organized grid with detailed views,
**so that** I can efficiently explore his portfolio and understand his technical capabilities.

## Goal
Create a responsive projects grid with interactive cards that open detailed project information in accessible sheet/drawer components, providing a smooth user experience for exploring portfolio projects.

## Background
The projects page needs a modern grid layout that showcases Zishan's portfolio projects with interactive cards. When users click on a project card, detailed information should appear in a sheet/drawer overlay that provides comprehensive project details, case studies, and metrics. The implementation must be accessible, performant, and work well on all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create responsive projects grid with masonry-style layout
2. Implement project cards with hover effects and proper accessibility
3. Add sheet/drawer component for detailed project views
4. Ensure smooth animations and transitions with reduced motion support
5. Display project metrics, technologies, and case study content in drawer
6. Implement keyboard navigation for cards and drawer interactions
7. Add project filtering by technology, category, or client
8. Ensure drawer closes properly with escape key and overlay clicks
9. Implement proper focus management when drawer opens/closes
10. Add analytics tracking for project card interactions

## Test Steps
1. Navigate to `/projects` page and verify responsive grid layout
2. Test project card hover effects and keyboard navigation
3. Click project cards and verify drawer opens with smooth animation
4. Test drawer content display and scrolling behavior
5. Verify escape key and overlay click close drawer functionality
6. Test focus management when drawer opens and closes
7. Verify reduced motion support for all animations
8. Test project filtering functionality
9. Verify analytics tracking for card clicks and drawer interactions
10. Test accessibility with screen reader and keyboard-only navigation

## Dev Notes
- **Grid Layout**: Use CSS Grid with masonry-style layout for optimal project card display
- **Sheet/Drawer**: Implement using Radix UI Dialog or similar accessible component
- **Content Structure**: Projects data includes title, description, technologies, metrics, case study, and links
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large project lists if needed
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion with reduced motion support
- **File Locations**:
  - `/app/projects/page.tsx` - Main projects page
  - `/components/content/projects-grid.tsx` - Projects grid component
  - `/components/content/project-card.tsx` - Individual project card
  - `/components/ui/project-drawer.tsx` - Project detail drawer
  - `/data/projects.json` - Projects content data
  - `/schemas/projects.ts` - Zod schema for projects

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test project card component, drawer component, and filtering logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test content loading from JSON and drawer interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete projects page functionality and drawer behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Verify smooth animations and grid rendering performance
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and focus management
